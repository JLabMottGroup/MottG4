This is the GEANT4 model of the JLab 5 MeV Mott Polarimeter. Any questions should be referred to 
Martin McHugh at mjmchugh@jlab.org.

The MottG4 repository contains the following directories:

CrossSections/		Scattering Functions based on calculations from prior to 2012
			Also contains CrossSectionTests.nb which was used to check event generators 				and compare new theory calculations to the extant results. 
			
Mott_Polarimeter/ 	Houses the actual GEANT4 code for the simulation as well as macros for
 			running the simulation in batch mode and scripts for interfacing with the
 			Auger system for job submissions to the JLab farm machines

NewMottPhysics/ 	Theory Calculations for single Mott scattering provided by Xavier. Forms
			the basis of the simulations generators. If we ever get new theory
			calculations, This needs to be altered.
			
scripts/		Contains scripts for analyzing the simulation outputs. Some are depricated
			since they are based on older versions of the simulation but may be of use
			for future efforts.
