            JLab MeV Mott Polarimeter GEANT4 Simulation 
     =========================================================


This simulation was build up from the GEANT4 ExampleN02. 

1) To compile:

 	> mkdir build && cd build
 	> cmake ..
 	> make
 	
   This will give you a directory, build/, in which all makefiles, object files, and the 
   excecutable, mott, are kept. 
    
2) To Run (Interactive Mode): 

	> cd $MOTTG4DIR/Mott_Polarimeter
	> ./build/mott
	
   A QT visualizer should appear which will allow you to interactively change parameters and run
   simulations
   
   To Run (Batch Mode):
   
	> cd $MOTTG4DIR/Mott_Polarimeter
	> ./build/mott macros/myRun.mac
	
   Runs the simulation in batch mode.  

3) Directory Contents:

	CMakeLists.txt - file for cmake
	g4jsub.pl - perl script for submitting jobs to the farm do:
			> perl g4jsub.pl --help 
   		for more info.
   	include/ - all the MottG4 class header files
   	macros/ - macros for batch simulations
   	Mott.cc - main() function
   	README - this document
   	src/ - This is the meat of the code. If you need to change something it's likely in the .cc
   		files contained in here.
   	vis.mac - macro for QT visualization during interactive running. DO NOT ALTER UNLESS YOU
   	KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
